# Daily Rainfall Predictor 
DSCI 525 Project Repo for Group 5

This project will explore different methods of cloud computing and big data techniques to be able to deploy an ensemble machine learning model that predicts the daily rainfall in NSW, Australia using a large dataset of over 5 GB. This model will utilize the 28 different modelling predictions as features to try to estimate and predict the observed rainfall. By the end of this project, the final model will be made accessible to others.
